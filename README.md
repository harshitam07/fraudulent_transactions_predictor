# fraudulent_transactions_predictor
This repository focuses on the detection of fraudulent transactions using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to build models that can effectively identify and predict fraudulent activities based on transaction data, helping organizations mitigate fraud risks and enhance security measures.

üöÄ Key Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing transaction data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distribution, detecting anomalies, and identifying key features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
Model Building: Implementing and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Insights & Reporting: Generating actionable insights and visualizations to understand fraud patterns.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies
Python: For data analysis and machine learning, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Machine Learning: Algorithms such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees for fraud detection.
Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations for EDA and insights.
Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive notebooks for analysis, model development, and documentation.
üìà Key Analysis & Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing transaction patterns, detecting outliers, and understanding feature distributions.
